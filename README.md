Python script meant to automate crafting in Path of Exile. Currently is made to craft on cluster jewels, but it should work for any item you want to alt spam into something.

To change what mods you want to search for just modify lines 8-11 (or add more lines) to have the keyword of the mod you want i.e. Powerful, Exile, Expulsion etc...

After setting mods that you want, run TransAltRegEx.py, follow the prompts, and let it cook
