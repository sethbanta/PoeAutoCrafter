Python script meant to automate crafting in Path of Exile. Currently is made to craft on cluster jewels, but it should work for any item you want to alt spam into something.

If you are having trouble running this you might need to install Pyautogui: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

How to use:

Run TransAltRegEx.py, follow the prompts, and let it cook.

If you want to cancel the program, flick your cursor to the top left of the screen. This will activate a fail safe that terminates the entire program.
